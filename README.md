# Scraping
-------------

## Disclaimer
---------------
This script was done to learn Python and scraping, don't take it too seriously.
I just had a simple idea that I let grow ending up like this.

This script will take all links of news in lavanguardia, el periodico and the 
guardian main page and put them into a file in Markdown format. Videos, Images
and Opinions news. It still lacks the photo gallery option, but in the end this 
script will end downloading the htmls so it can be used to any webpage and give 
it a more general use. Since Obsidian or other Note applications can render html 
code.

Update: most of it is already done and more!
